Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is a type of Cybersecurity threat which is one of many versions of Denial of Service(DoS) that uses IP addresses to attack a particular server/victim. DDoS threats are well-coordinated attacks that uses a compromised secondary victims to target the single or multiple victim systems may it be a large firm server or a small scale system. The DDoS threats are very costly in terms of bandwidth and power and they result in loss of confidential data as well. Therefore it has become of much importance to devise better al- gorithms to detect different types of DDoS Cyberthreats with higher accuracy while considering the computation cost in detecting these threats. Most of the study conducted in literature assumes detection of DDoS threats as a binary clas- sification problem and their results give out whether an attack was attempted or not. However, in order to effectively defend the network from causing extensive damage, it is of paramount importance to know which type of DDoS attack is targeting the network or the system. This repo, presents an Ensemble Classifier that combines the performance of top 4 performing algorithm and compares it with different Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI and ML) algo- rithms to effectively detect the different types of DDoS threats by converting the problem to a multilabel classification problem.
